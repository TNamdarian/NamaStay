This is a fictional website designed for practicing the skills that I’ve learnt in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The reason I’ve chosen this project is because of my passion for yoga and I wish to join many retreats in the future around the UK. The website features ‘about’, 'ethos', ‘testimonials’, 'call for action', ‘the retreat locations, ‘FQAs’, ‘contact form’, ‘footer’ with the ‘social media links’. The objective of this project is for people to find new retreat locations or register theirs if they want to join the list. 

Choosing a yoga retreat depends on various factors such as locations, familiarity with the place of choice before traveling there. Being able to contact with the service providers as well as connecting with the communities online. Therefore, the website aims to provide useful information such as the benefits of yoga retreats, listing several retreats, and sharing the fictional clients’ testimonials to build trust with potential clients. There is a FAQs section where the users can read answers and make enquiries if they have a specific question. 

The business goals of this website are:
* Increase brand awareness.
* Reach wider clients by listing various yoga retreats.
* Simple and straightforward UX design close to the developer’s concept i.e., simplicity. 
* Connect yoga lovers to their desired yoga retreats. 

Users visit this website to:
* Search for a reputable retreat experience. 
* Read about each retreat and choose their favourite one(s). 
* Reach the event organiser and get in touch easily. 
* Find the contact information effortlessly by filling up a form to make enquiries, register their retreats or just connect. 

# UX
Since the first Covid lockdown the mental health has become of one the most important aspects of our lives. In this project, I tried to promote the importance of yoga through socializing and benefits of retreats to boost wellbeing in general. Not being able to travel outside of the UK freely, I ensured I included enough retreat options locally and linked them to their original websites for the users to get further information. Each page links the user to the next page to direct them to retreats’ locations and contact page.   

### Ideal client 
The ideal client for this website is: 
* English speaking
* Yoga lovers
* Located in the UK
* People are into wellbeing, yoga, nature, and retreats 
* People who are willing to spend money on themselves and their health
* Would like to register a retreat with NamaStay

The project help clients to: 
* navigate easily through the website and reach the information they need easily. 
* learn about the retreats and their locations, read previous clients’ testimonials and FAQs, and connect with the organizer via social media. 

### User stories: 
1.	As a user, I want to easily navigate the site to find my ideal yoga retreat. 
2.	As an owner of a yoga retreat, I would like to find out if this website is trustworthy and reputable by seeing what the previous clients say about them so I can collaborate with them. 
3.	As a visitor, I would like to learn more about the yoga retreats via their landing pages. 
4.	As a user, I would like to know how to contact the organizer to book a retreat. 
5.	As a customer, I want to be able to contact the organiser easily. 
6.	As a potential client, I would like to learn more about the organiser and get validation via their social media. It is more reassuring to trust businesses who have a solid follower base.  
7.	As a returning visitor to the website, I want to be able to find the contact page easily to reach the organiser.

### Scope
To achieve the strategic goals, I included the following features in the website: 
* Header containing website’s logo/name and the menu bar including Home, Retreats, and Contact. The menu toggles when the user clicks on it and it pans out the nav bar. 
* Home page which says about the purpose of the website, benefits of yoga retreats and testimonials. 
* Call for action button on about and retreat pages. 
* Retreats list including names linked to external websites and their locations on a Google map. When user hovers over each retreat, they can see the locations popping up on the map. 
* Testimonials including the name of fictional yogis and their experiences.
* FAQs to allow users find answers to commonly asked questions. 
* Contact form to allow users contact the organiser to register, inquire or book a retreat. 
* Footer on every page containing the links to the organiser’s social media which upon hovering it triggers the number of followers and subscribers. 

## Skeleton 
The website consists of three pages; About (introduces the aim of the website, benefits of yoga and testimonials), Retreats (including the map locating various retreats), and Contact (including FAQs and a contact form). All pages have the same logo, nav bar and footer. 

### Wireframe Mockups: 
* [Home]()
* [Retreats]()
* [Contact]()


## Surface 
The logo and a toggled menu bar are positions in the left- and right-hand sides of the website in the header incorporating dark green colour. When the menu icon is clicked, it toggles and opens a green and cream navbar on the left side of the page. The earthy colours throughout the website have been chosen to represent nature, serenity, pureness, and energy.  I have chosen dark typography yet bold styles to show strength. The light green and orange colours have been taken from the banner image on the About page for call-to-action buttons, and social media icons. The combination of white, cream, light pink, light blue and dark green colours convey a sense of positivity, energy, and freshness. 

# Features 
### Header
The **header** contains a **logo** and **menu** option on either top corner of each page. This will create consistency throughout the website. Once the user clicks on the menu on the right corner, it toggles open a navbar from left to right containing links to pages i.e., **About**, **Retreats** and **Contact** as well as the organiser’s contact details. The user can access the information via the navbar on the left side and move around the site. The links will remain active (change to orange) when in use.

### Footer
Every page has a **footer** with links to **social media**. The social media icons are linked to the general social networks as this is fictional website. The followers and subscribers’ numbers are unreal and made up. When the user hovers over the icons the number increment to show the exact number of followers and subscribers. 

### About
The About page features an illustration / **banner** to introduce the theme of the website. To the left side of the image, there is a line about what the website offers and a **call-to-action** button: *Let’s begin!* which takes the user to the **Retreats** page. 
At the bottom of these, the **ethos** are presented. This encourages users to book a retreat as they are informative and factual. It will enhance user’s emotional response. 
The **testimonials** cards are placed below the ethos to build trust and credibility and accountability of the organiser. When user clicks on each card, they expand to allow users to read the texts. 
Finally, there is a **call-to-action** button: *Take me there!* to make the pages link together and navigation around the site more smooth. 
The About page also uses cream and light pink colors and fun illustrations to separate each section and create positive user response. 

### Retreats
The Retreats page features a **Google map** on the left-hand side of the page and a list of retreats on the right. When the user hover on each retreat item, they can see the location of the retreat on the map. Moving to a new item, the Window Info will close and another one will open. By clicking on each item, the user will be taken to an external website where they can learn more about that specific place. 
At the bottom of the page, there is a **call-to-action** button: *Contact us!*. In case users couldn’t find a retreat, they could get in touch with the organiser to receive more information. 
The Retreats page also uses cream and light pink colors and fun illustrations to separate each section and create positive user response. These colours are in coordination with the rest of the website. 

### Contact  
The contact page features the **FAQs**. Each question is wrapped in a box. when users click on the arrow, they can expand the box to read the answers.  Clicking on the cross (x) will hide the answer. 
Then, there is a **Contact Form** which user can fill up to reach the organiser to make enquires, book or register a retreat. 
The bottom of the form contains a **Submit!** button.

# Features to Implement in future
Due to time restraints, I was unable to include the following features but hope to implement them in a future release:
* A blog to share educational articles and guides for added value. 
* Live Chat app - To provide an instant connection between the user and organiser with high visibility on the site. 
* Option to choose the language of the website - As the developer’s second language is Farsi, this would allow Farsi speaking visitors to the website to view it in their native language. 
* Add a download button for a white paper for digital marketing purposes and building an email list in the future. 
* A booking and payment to be added to the website. 
* A search button to be added so users can put their desired location and search it on the website. 
* Allow the website to use user’s location.
