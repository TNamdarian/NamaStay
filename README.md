This is a fictional website designed for practicing the skills that I’ve learnt in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The reason I’ve chosen this project is because of my passion for yoga and I wish to join many retreats in the future around the UK. The website features ‘about’, 'ethos', ‘testimonials’, 'call for action', ‘the retreat locations, ‘FQAs’, ‘contact form’, ‘footer’ with the ‘social media links’. The objective of this project is for people to find new retreat locations or register theirs if they want to join the list. 

Choosing a yoga retreat depends on various factors such as locations, familiarity with the place of choice before traveling there. Being able to contact with the service providers as well as connecting with the communities online. Therefore, the website aims to provide useful information such as the benefits of yoga retreats, listing several retreats, and sharing the fictional clients’ testimonials to build trust with potential clients. There is a FAQs section where the users can read answers and make enquiries if they have a specific question. 

The business goals of this website are:
* Increase brand awareness.
* Reach wider clients by listing various yoga retreats.
* Simple and straightforward UX design close to the developer’s concept i.e., simplicity. 
* Connect yoga lovers to their desired yoga retreats. 

Users visit this website to:
* Search for a reputable retreat experience. 
* Read about each retreat and choose their favourite one(s). 
* Reach the event organiser and get in touch easily. 
* Find the contact information effortlessly by filling up a form to make enquiries, register their retreats or just connect. 

# UX
Since the first Covid lockdown the mental health has become of one the most important aspects of our lives. In this project, I tried to promote the importance of yoga through socializing and benefits of retreats to boost wellbeing in general. Not being able to travel outside of the UK freely, I ensured I included enough retreat options locally and linked them to their original websites for the users to get further information. Each page links the user to the next page to direct them to retreats’ locations and contact page.   

### Ideal client 
The ideal client for this website is: 
* English speaking
* Yoga lovers
* Located in the UK
* People are into wellbeing, yoga, nature, and retreats 
* People who are willing to spend money on themselves and their health
* Would like to register a retreat with NamaStay

The project help clients to: 
* navigate easily through the website and reach the information they need easily. 
* learn about the retreats and their locations, read previous clients’ testimonials and FAQs, and connect with the organizer via social media. 

### User stories: 
1.	As a user, I want to easily navigate the site to find my ideal yoga retreat. 
2.	As an owner of a yoga retreat, I would like to find out if this website is trustworthy and reputable by seeing what the previous clients say about them so I can collaborate with them. 
3.	As a visitor, I would like to learn more about the yoga retreats via their landing pages. 
4.	As a user, I would like to know how to contact the organizer to book a retreat. 
5.	As a customer, I want to be able to contact the organiser easily. 
6.	As a potential client, I would like to learn more about the organiser and get validation via their social media. It is more reassuring to trust businesses who have a solid follower base.  
7.	As a returning visitor to the website, I want to be able to find the contact page easily to reach the organiser.

### Scope
To achieve the strategic goals, I included the following features in the website: 
* Header containing website’s logo/name and the menu bar including Home, Retreats, and Contact. The menu toggles when the user clicks on it and it pans out the nav bar. 
* Home page which says about the purpose of the website, benefits of yoga retreats and testimonials. 
* Call for action button on about and retreat pages. 
* Retreats list including names linked to external websites and their locations on a Google map. When user hovers over each retreat, they can see the locations popping up on the map. 
* Testimonials including the name of fictional yogis and their experiences.
* FAQs to allow users find answers to commonly asked questions. 
* Contact form to allow users contact the organiser to register, inquire or book a retreat. 
* Footer on every page containing the links to the organiser’s social media which upon hovering it triggers the number of followers and subscribers. 

## Skeleton 
The website consists of three pages; About (introduces the aim of the website, benefits of yoga and testimonials), Retreat (including the map locating various retreats), and Contact (including FAQs and a contact form).
