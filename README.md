This is a fictional website designed for practicing the skills that I’ve learnt in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The reason I’ve chosen this project is because of my passion for yoga and I wish to join many retreats in the future around the UK. The website features ‘about’, 'ethos', ‘testimonials’, 'call for action', ‘the retreat locations, ‘FQAs’, ‘contact form’, ‘footer’ with the ‘social media links’. The objective of this project is for people to find new retreat locations or register theirs if they want to join the list. 

Choosing a yoga retreat depends on various factors such as locations, familiarity with the place of choice before traveling there. Being able to contact with the service providers as well as connecting with the communities online. Therefore, the website aims to provide useful information such as the benefits of yoga retreats, listing several retreats, and sharing the fictional clients’ testimonials to build trust with potential clients. There is a FAQs section where the users can read answers and make enquiries if they have a specific question. 

The business goals of this website are:
* Increase brand awareness.
* Reach wider clients by listing various yoga retreats.
* Simple and straightforward UX design close to the developer’s concept i.e., simplicity. 
* Connect yoga lovers to their desired yoga retreats. 

Users visit this website to:
* Search for a reputable retreat experience. 
* Read about each retreat and choose their favourite one(s). 
* Reach the event organiser and get in touch easily. 
* Find the contact information effortlessly by filling up a form to make enquiries, register their retreats or just connect. 

# UX
Since the first Covid lockdown the mental health has become of one the most important aspects of our lives. In this project, I tried to promote the importance of yoga through socializing and benefits of retreats to boost wellbeing in general. Not being able to travel outside of the UK freely, I ensured I included enough retreat options locally and linked them to their original websites for the users to get further information. Each page links the user to the next page to direct them to retreats’ locations and contact page.   










# Further testing
I asked my friends and family to click on the deployed link on their devices especially iPads and 17" and bigger laptops which I do not personally own. I added further bootstrap padding and margin and CSS media queries to make the website responsive on all devices.
