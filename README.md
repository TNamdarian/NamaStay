This is a fictional website designed for practicing the skills that I’ve learnt in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The reason I’ve chosen this project is because of my passion for yoga and I wish to join many retreats in the future around the UK. The website features ‘about’, 'ethos', ‘testimonials’, 'call for action', ‘the retreat locations, ‘FQAs’, ‘contact form’, ‘footer’ with the ‘social media links’. The objective of this project is for people to find new retreat locations or register theirs if they want to join the list.
